                <h1>Extracting Secrets</h1>

<p class="summary"><em>This project explores different methods for extracting secrets from a binary
using the compiled C binary <a href="assets/secret_treasure">secret_treasure</a> and
the encrypted file <a href="assets/treasures.enc">treasures.enc</a>.</em></p>

<p>Often, software has secrets that it's trying to hide or data that it is refusing
access to. For example, game companies want to keep players from copying their
content; management software has API keys and sensitive data that could be
dangerous for hackers to get their hands on.</p>

<p>An naive software developer may include those secrets directly in the code.
Thus, if a hacker gets access to the code, they have access to the secrets
directly. A more security-minded software developer might keep those secrets in
a seperate file, possible encrypted. This could make it more difficult for a
hacker to gain access to the secrets, since the files are usually not stored
with the code.</p>

<p>However, in spite of this, it is still possible for a hacker to gain access to
this data, even if it's encrypted, through the use of a debugger or code
modification tools.</p>

<p>In this project, I am given a compiled C binary, <code class="inline-code">secret_treasure</code>, and an
encrypted file, <code class="inline-code">treasures.enc</code>. When run, the program prompts for a secret key.
It then checks the input secret key to see if it is valid. If it is, the program
prints out a random hidden treasure (some sort of quote). If it isn't, the
program prints out <code class="inline-code">Who are you trying to fool?</code> (see Figure 1).</p>

<img alt="A normal run of the `secret_treasure` binary with an invalid password" src="images/normal-run.png"/>

<p>Using this binary and its associated treasures, I will explore how the security
measures implemented in this binary (password protection and secret encryption)
can be circumvented with a debugger and with binary modification tools.</p>


<h2>Circumvention by Debugger</h2>

<p>First, I will circumvent the security measures with the GDB debugger. To begin,
I open up the binary in <code class="inline-code">gdb</code>:</p>

<pre class="code-block bash"><code>gdb secret_treasure</code></pre>

<p>After setting the layout to display the assembly code with <code class="inline-code">layout asm</code>, I set a
breakpoint at the beginning of the <code class="inline-code">main</code> function with <code class="inline-code">break main</code>. Then, I
run the program with <code class="inline-code">treasures.enc</code> as an argument, with all input read from
<code class="inline-code">input.txt</code>, and with all output written to <code class="inline-code">output.txt</code> (so as not to mess with
the debugger display). I do this with <code class="inline-code">run treasures.enc &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt</code>. <code class="inline-code">input.txt</code> has the string <code class="inline-code">not_a_password</code>, which is not the
correct password.</p>

<p>After that, I step through the code with <code class="inline-code">next</code> until I step over the
instruction that calls <code class="inline-code">checkKey</code>. This leaves me on a <code class="inline-code">cmpl</code> instruction, which
is the check that causes the program to exit early if the password is not valid.
In order to determine which variable I should modify, I print the variables with
<code class="inline-code">info locals</code>. Seeing that there is a variable labeled <code class="inline-code">isValidKey</code>, I set it to
true (or <code class="inline-code">1</code>) with <code class="inline-code">set isValidKey = 1</code>. Finally, I let the program run to
completion with <code class="inline-code">continue</code>.</p>

<p>Once the program has completed, I am able to find one of the treasures printed
out in <code class="inline-code">output.txt</code>.</p>

<p>My complete GDB session is as follows:</p>

<pre class="code-block gdb"><code>layout asm
break main

run treasures.enc &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt

next
# ... repeat until I reach the `cmpl` instruction

info locals
set isValidKey = 1
continue</code></pre>

<img alt="A GDB session where I have just set `isValidKey` to `1`" src="images/gdb-modify-variable.png"/>


<h2>Circumvention by Modifying the Binary</h2>

<p>Another way that I could get around the check is to modify it to accept both
<code class="inline-code">true</code> <em>and</em> <code class="inline-code">false</code>. I could do this by modifying the jump instruction. As I
was running the circumvention with the debugger, I encountered the <code class="inline-code">cmpl</code> and
<code class="inline-code">jne</code> instruction, which says that if the value is not equal to 0, jump ahead.
This means that if the value is <code class="inline-code">true</code> it jumps to the code that decrypts the
treasure, while if the value is <code class="inline-code">false</code>, it doesn't jump, and it proceeds to
exit the program. These instructions are shown in Figure 3.</p>

<img alt="The jump instructions that decide whether or not to exit the program" src="images/jump-instruction.png"/>

<p>Instead of having to modify the <code class="inline-code">isValidKey</code> variable each time I run the
program in GDB, I can just modify the jump instruction to allow me to access it
no matter what.</p>

<p>My initial thought was to switch the <code class="inline-code">jne</code> (Jump Not Equal) instruction to a
<code class="inline-code">jge</code> (Jump Greater or Equal) instruction, since both <code class="inline-code">0</code> and <code class="inline-code">1</code> are greater
than or equal to <code class="inline-code">0</code>. However, I don't actually know for sure what <code class="inline-code">isValidKey</code>
returns, other than the fact that a <code class="inline-code">0</code> indicates that the program should quit.
<code class="inline-code">isValidKey</code> could return <code class="inline-code">-1</code> to indicate <code class="inline-code">true</code>, in which case the program
would still exit, since <code class="inline-code">-1</code> is not greater than or equal to <code class="inline-code">0</code>. I could step
through <code class="inline-code">isValidKey</code>, but I'm not sure how long or complex <code class="inline-code">isValidKey</code> is, and
I don't feel like taking the time to find out.</p>

<p>So, instead of switching it to <code class="inline-code">jge</code> (Jump Greater or Equal), I decide to switch
it to <code class="inline-code">jmp</code> (Unconditional Jump). This way, no matter what value <code class="inline-code">isValidKey</code>
has, the program will always jump past the exit instructions.</p>

<p>So, I find the machine code associated with the instruction with <code class="inline-code">objdump</code>. I
open the <code class="inline-code">secret_treasure</code> binary with <code class="inline-code">objdump</code> and feed the output to <code class="inline-code">less</code>
for easier viewing and searching. The argument <code class="inline-code">-M intel</code> describes what dialect
of machine code to display, and the argument <code class="inline-code">-d</code> indicates that the executable
sections should be disassembled and displayed.</p>

<pre class="code-block bash"><code>objdump -M intel -d secret_treasure | less</code></pre>

<p>Then, I find the instructions for <code class="inline-code">main</code> in the output, after which I find the
specific <code class="inline-code">jne</code> instruction that I'd noticed earlier.</p>

<img alt="The section of the binary with the `jne` instruction" src="images/program-instructions.png"/>

<p>Next, I open up the binary in <code class="inline-code">vim</code>. The <code class="inline-code">-b</code> flag allows for easier
modification of binary files.</p>

<pre class="code-block bash"><code>vim -b secret_treasure</code></pre>

<p>Once it is open, I convert it to a human-readable hexadecimal encoding with <code class="inline-code">:%! xxd</code>.
Then, I search for the sequence of hexadecimal characters for the <code class="inline-code">jne</code>
instruction. Once I find the correct bytes. I switch the <code class="inline-code">jne</code> byte, <code class="inline-code">75</code>, to a
<code class="inline-code">jmp</code> byte, <code class="inline-code">eb</code>. Finally, I convert back to bytes with <code class="inline-code">:%! xxd -r</code> and save
it.</p>

<p>I then print out the instruction dump again to verify that the instruction has
changed.</p>

<img alt="The section of the binary with the modified `jmp` instruction" src="images/program-instructions-modified.png"/>

<p>After this, I run the program a couple times to verify that it accepts any password.</p>

<img alt="A series of successful runs with different passwords" src="images/successful-runs.png"/>


<h2>Finding <em>All</em> the Treasures!</h2>

<p>So, I can get random treasures from the encoded file. However, I've been
informed that there are some treasures that will never be printed. So I need to
find another way to get <em>all</em> the treasures.</p>

<p>In order to get <em>all</em> the treasures, I am going to print out the value of the
string that is decrypted from the file. As I was debugging, I noticed that there
is a <code class="inline-code">readQuotes</code> function. I look into that function further in the instruction
dump, and I find that there's a section a call to <code class="inline-code">decryptCipher</code> and a call to
<code class="inline-code">strstr</code>, which I suspect is where the treasures are split up into individual
strings. So I can print the output of <code class="inline-code">decryptCipher</code> to find the string with
all of the treasures.</p>

<img alt="The instructions between the call to `decryptCipher` and `strstr`" src="images/vulnerable-section.png"/>

<p>So, I fire up GDB and run <code class="inline-code">layout asm</code>. I set a break point inside of
<code class="inline-code">readQuotes</code> with <code class="inline-code">break readQuotes</code>. Then I run the program with `run
treasures.enc &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt`, like before.</p>

<p>Once it hits the breakpoint in <code class="inline-code">readQuotes</code>, I step through the instructions
with <code class="inline-code">next</code> until it passes the <code class="inline-code">decryptCipher</code> call. Then, listing the local
variables with <code class="inline-code">info locals</code>, I see a variable labeled <code class="inline-code">plaintext</code>. I run <code class="inline-code">call
printf("%s", plaintext)</code> so that all the treasures are printed to the output
file. Finally, I run <code class="inline-code">continue</code> to finish the program and flush <code class="inline-code">stdout</code>.</p>

<p>Once this is complete, I check output file and find a series of <code class="inline-code">-&amp;&amp;&amp;-</code>
delimited treasures, plus a little garbled text at the end (which I assume is
because this string is not null-terminated). Thus, the treasures that I found were as follows:</p>

<pre class="code-block"><code>-&amp;&amp;&amp;-
