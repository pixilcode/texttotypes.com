# Project 8 - Extracting Secrets

Often, software has secrets that it's trying to hide or data that it is refusing
access to. For example, game companies want to keep players from copying their
content; management software has API keys and sensitive data that could be
dangerous for hackers to get their hands on.

An naive software developer may include those secrets directly in the code.
Thus, if a hacker gets access to the code, they have access to the secrets
directly. A more security-minded software developer might keep those secrets in
a seperate file, possible encrypted. This could make it more difficult for a
hacker to gain access to the secrets, since the files are usually not stored
with the code.

However, in spite of this, it is still possible for a hacker to gain access to
this data, even if it's encrypted, through the use of a debugger or code
modification tools.

In this project, I am given a compiled C binary, `secret_treasure`, and an
encrypted file, `treasures.enc`. When run, the program prompts for a secret key.
It then checks the input secret key to see if it is valid. If it is, the program
prints out a random hidden treasure (some sort of quote). If it isn't, the
program prints out `Who are you trying to fool?` (see Figure 1).

Using this binary and its associated treasures, I will explore how the security
measures implemented in this binary (password protection and secret encryption)
can be circumvented with a debugger and with binary modification tools.


## Circumvention by Debugger

First, I will circumvent the security measures with the GDB debugger. To begin,
I open up the binary in `gdb`:

```bash
gdb secret_treasure
```

After setting the layout to display the assembly code with `layout asm`, I set a
breakpoint at the beginning of the `main` function with `break main`. Then, I
run the program with `treasures.enc` as an argument, with all input read from
`input.txt`, and with all output written to `output.txt` (so as not to mess with
the debugger display). I do this with `run treasures.enc < input.txt >
output.txt`. `input.txt` has the string `not_a_password`, which is not the
correct password.

After that, I step through the code with `next` until I step over the
instruction that calls `checkKey`. This leaves me on a `cmpl` instruction, which
is the check that causes the program to exit early if the password is not valid.
In order to determine which variable I should modify, I print the variables with
`info locals`. Seeing that there is a variable labeled `isValidKey`, I set it to
true (or `1`) with `set isValidKey = 1`. Finally, I let the program run to
completion with `continue`.

Once the program has completed, I am able to find one of the treasures printed
out in `output.txt`.

My complete GDB session is as follows:

```gdb
layout asm
break main

run treasures.enc < input.txt > output.txt

next
# ... repeat until I reach the `cmpl` instruction

info locals
set isValidKey = 1
continue
```

![A GDB session where I have just set `isValidKey` to `1`](images/gdb-modify-variable.png)


## Circumvention by Modifying the Binary

Another way that I could get around the check is to modify it to accept both
`true` *and* `false`. I could do this by modifying the jump instruction. As I
was running the circumvention with the debugger, I encountered the `cmpl` and
`jne` instruction, which says that if the value is not equal to 0, jump ahead.
This means that if the value is `true` it jumps to the code that decrypts the
treasure, while if the value is `false`, it doesn't jump, and it proceeds to
exit the program. These instructions are shown in Figure 3.

![The jump instructions that decide whether or not to exit the program](images/jump-instruction.png)

Instead of having to modify the `isValidKey` variable each time I run the
program in GDB, I can just modify the jump instruction to allow me to access it
no matter what.

My initial thought was to switch the `jne` (Jump Not Equal) instruction to a
`jge` (Jump Greater or Equal) instruction, since both `0` and `1` are greater
than or equal to `0`. However, I don't actually know for sure what `isValidKey`
returns, other than the fact that a `0` indicates that the program should quit.
`isValidKey` could return `-1` to indicate `true`, in which case the program
would still exit, since `-1` is not greater than or equal to `0`. I could step
through `isValidKey`, but I'm not sure how long or complex `isValidKey` is, and
I don't feel like taking the time to find out.

So, instead of switching it to `jge` (Jump Greater or Equal), I decide to switch
it to `jmp` (Unconditional Jump). This way, no matter what value `isValidKey`
has, the program will always jump past the exit instructions.

So, I find the machine code associated with the instruction with `objdump`. I
open the `secret_treasure` binary with `objdump` and feed the output to `less`
for easier viewing and searching. The argument `-M intel` describes what dialect
of machine code to display, and the argument `-d` indicates that the executable
sections should be disassembled and displayed.

```bash
objdump -M intel -d secret_treasure | less
```

Then, I find the instructions for `main` in the output, after which I find the
specific `jne` instruction that I'd noticed earlier.

![The section of the binary with the `jne` instruction](images/program-instructions.png)

Next, I open up the binary in `vim`. The `-b` flag allows for easier
modification of binary files.

```bash
vim -b secret_treasure
```

Once it is open, I convert it to a human-readable hexadecimal encoding with `:%!
xxd`. Then, I search for the sequence of hexadecimal characters for the `jne`
instruction. Once I find the correct bytes. I switch the `jne` byte, `75`, to a
`jmp` byte, `eb`. Finally, I convert back to bytes with `:%! xxd -r` and save
it.

I then print out the instruction dump again to verify that the instruction has
changed.

![The section of the binary with the modified `jmp` instruction](images/program-instructions-modified.png)

After this, I run the program a couple times to verify that it accepts any password.

## Finding *All* the Treasures!

So, I can get random treasures from the encoded file. However, I've been
informed that there are some treasures that will never be printed. So I need to
find another way to get *all* the treasures.

In order to get *all* the treasures, I am going to print out the value of the
string that is decrypted from the file. As I was debugging, I noticed that there
is a `readQuotes` function. I look into that function further in the instruction
dump, and I find that there's a section a call to `decryptCipher` and a call to
`strstr`, which I suspect is where the treasures are split up into individual
strings. So I can print the output of `decryptCipher` to find the string with
all of the treasures.

![The instructions between the call to `decryptCipher` and `strstr`](images/vulnerable-section.png)

So, I fire up GDB and run `layout asm`. I set a break point inside of
`readQuotes` with `break readQuotes`. Then I run the program with `run
treasures.enc < input.txt > output.txt`, like before.

Once it hits the breakpoint in `readQuotes`, I step through the instructions
with `next` until it passes the `decryptCipher` call. Then, listing the local
variables with `info locals`, I see a variable labeled `plaintext`. I run `call
printf("%s", plaintext)` so that all the treasures are printed to the output
file. Finally, I run `continue` to finish the program and flush `stdout`.

Once this is complete, I check output file and find a series of `-&&&-`
delimited treasures, plus a little garbled text at the end (which I assume is
because this string is not null-terminated). Thus, the treasures that I found were as follows:
