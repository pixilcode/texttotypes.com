# Challenge 1 - Bypass Me If You Can

*Written by kova.tuuli*

The solution to this challenge is simple SQL injection. The username input
isn't sanitized, so we can just enter `' OR TRUE; -- ` as the username and it
will log us in as the first user in the database.

## Explanation

Imagine the SQL query that is being run to check the username and password is
something like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'username' AND password = 'password';
```

where `username` and `password` are the values entered by the user. The page
treats the user as logged in if the query returns at least one row. So, if we
enter `' OR TRUE; -- ` as the username, the query will become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR TRUE; -- ' AND password = '';
```

The `--` is a comment in SQL, so the rest of the query is ignored. Because the
`WHERE` clause is now `WHERE username = '' OR TRUE`, it will always evaluate to
true, so the query will return all the rows in the `users` table. The page will
then treat the user as logged in using the first user in the table.

## Vulnerabilities

There are two main problems with the code in this challenge. The first is that
the username input isn't sanitized (special characters like `'` aren't escaped),
so it's possible to inject SQL by starting the input with `'`, since that closes
the string that is supposed to contain the username.

The second problem is that the SQL error message is displayed to the user, which
tells the user that the input is vulnerable to SQL injection. In addition, the 
error message mentions that the database is MySQL, which helps the attacker to
know which SQL syntax to use. In general, error messages should never be passed
from a database or library directly to the end user. Instead, they should be
logged internally and the user should be shown a generic error message.
