# Hash Me If You Can

*Written by kova.tuuli*

For this challenge, my initial thought was to write a simple JavaScript script to
extract the message from the page and hash it using SHA-512. Then, I would do a
page redirect to the correct page. The script I wrote is shown below. (The function `sha512` was found on StackOverflow)

```js
function sha512(str) {
    return crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-512', new TextEncoder("utf-8").encode(str)).then(buf => {
        return Array.prototype.map.call(new Uint8Array(buf), x=>(('00'+x.toString(16)).slice(-2))).join('');
    });
}

let message = document.querySelector('.message')
let messageText = message.innerText.split('\n')[1]

window.location = `http://challenges.ringzer0team.com:10013/?r=${sha512(messageText)}`
```

I attempted to run this. However, because the site is served over HTTP instead of
HTTPS, the browser didn't allow access to crypto.subtle. I tried to find a way to
bypass this, including using `fetch` from an HTTPS site, but nothing worked.

So I turned to scripting on my own machine in [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/). I wrote the following script
that accomplished the task:

```nu
#!/usr/bin/env nu

let message = (
	http get "http://challenges.ringzer0team.com:10013" # get the original page
	| lines # split into lines
	| get 39 # get the 40th line, which contains the message
	| str trim # trim whitespace
	| split row "<" # get rid of the <br> tag
	| get 0 # get rid of the <br> tag
)

let sha_hash = (
	$message
	| sha512sum # hash the message
	| split row " " # get rid of the extra ' -'
	| get 0 # get rid of the extra ' -'
)

let url = $"http://challenges.ringzer0team.com:10013/?r=($sha_hash)" # set up the response URL
http get $url | grep --ignore-case --only-matching 'FLAG-[a-z0-9]*' # get the flag from the response
```
