# About

Greetings! I am a passionate Computer Science student with a profound interest
in the design, semantics, and features of programming languages. My academic
journey revolves around studying and building programming languages, with a keen
focus on the latest advances in functional programming and type systems.
Currently, I'm delving into the fascinating world of algebraic effects. My
preferred programming languages include Rust for performance-critical
applications, Elm for creating interactive web pages, OCaml for its powerful
functional type system, and TypeScript for simpler scripts.

Among my notable achievements, I have created Tego, a dynamically-typed
functional programming language, showcasing my dedication to innovation and
exploration in the field. My approach to both my studies and hobbies is driven
by an insatiable curiosity and a desire to challenge conventional wisdom. I
thrive on discovering new perspectives and questioning underlying assumptions,
always aiming to push the boundaries of what is possible. Outside of my academic
pursuits, I enjoy sword fighting in the Belegarth sport, crafting through
crochet and knitting, and exploring other random hobbies!
